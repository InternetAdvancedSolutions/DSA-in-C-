__________________

*Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort.

*Is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted.

*Compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

*The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

*The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, 

 is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
